OSMM-Styling
============

## About
This style tool can be run against your OS MasterMap Topography data to create and calculate the fields and values for applying the correct styles.

## Quickstart

A toolbox is included in this repository and can be used to run the tool. 

The style tool takes 3 parameters:

- The geodatabase containing the data
- The table prefix used when loading the data
- The tool mode. This will be either "Add Style" to add and creatw the required styles or "Remove Columns" to delete any style columns already added.
