OSMM-Styling
============

## About
This style tool can be run against your OS MasterMap Topography data to create and calculate the fields and values for applying the correct styles.

## Quickstart

A toolbox is included in this repository and can be used to run the tool. Download the repository zip file and extract it to disk. 

The style tool takes 3 parameters:

- The geodatabase containing the data
- The table prefix used when loading the data
- The tool mode. This will be either "Add Style" to add and creatw the required styles or "Remove Columns" to delete any style columns already added.

The python scripts can also be run using the batch file included in the repository.
